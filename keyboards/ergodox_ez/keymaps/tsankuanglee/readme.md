# ErgoDox EZ Tsan-Kuang Lee's configuration

## TODO
[ ] Consider removing Layer 1 and replace with SWAP HAND
[ ] Make the modifier keys mirrored so SWAP HAND works better.
[ ] Consider move/add mouse buttons to the right hand so drag and drop is easier.
[ ] Consider moving TO(n) to one layer

## Changelog

* 2018-11-02
  * Merge from upstream
* 2017-08-07
  * Stable version
  * My setup is primarily for coding and text inputing. The hand-swapping is for image editting (with the mouse in my right hand, the left hand can still hit any hot key).
    * Layer 0 is very close to a general keyboard.
    * Layer 1 right now is the mirrored left/right layout, useful for one hand operation.
    * Layer 2 completes F1-F24 function keys and the number pad.
    * Layer 3: mouse, arrows.
    * Layer 4: hardware control (media, keyboard, machine).
    * Layer 5: CTRL+CMD+Fn for OS defined shortcuts.
    * Layer 6: for an specific application.
    * Layer 7: reserved.
