# Tsan-Kuang Lee's ErgoDox-Ez Configuration

This is my personal keymap. I am right handed, and use my mouse with my right hand. Many layers are designed for me to keep my right hand on the mouse while the left hand has access to most keys. Sometimes I also keep my right hand on the keyboard and use my left hand to touch the screen.

About Ergodox-ez's Configurator: I use it to produce the base key layouts and download its keymap.c file to build upon. In the Changelogbelow, I include the URL to the visualized layouts; note that the configuration only supports a subset of QMK functions, so the visualization only shows a rough setup.

## Changelog

* 2018-11-08-b

* 2018-11-07
  * [My setup with ErgoDox-Ez Configurator](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/layouts/XlaM)
  * After more than a year of using this, I decided to re-design the whole thing.
  * Re-organized function keys, media keys, keypads, and the base layer.
  * Dedicate a layer that contains all TO(n)
  * Removed Layer 1, which was the mirrored layer, and replace it with SWAP HAND
  * Move overlays to high layers so more lower layers can use them.
  * Add mouse button to the right hand side, so drag and drop is easier.
  * Dim the LEDs. They were blindingly bright!

* 2018-11-02
  * Merge from upstream

* 2017-08-07
  * Stable version
  * My setup is primarily for coding and text inputing. The hand-swapping is for image editting (with the mouse in my right hand, the left hand can still hit any hot key).
    * Layer 0 is very close to a general keyboard.
    * Layer 1 right now is the mirrored left/right layout, useful for one hand operation.
    * Layer 2 completes F1-F24 function keys and the number pad.
    * Layer 3: mouse, arrows.
    * Layer 4: hardware control (media, keyboard, machine).
    * Layer 5: CTRL+CMD+Fn for OS defined shortcuts.
    * Layer 6: for an specific application.
    * Layer 7: reserved.

* 2017-07-07
  * Draft
